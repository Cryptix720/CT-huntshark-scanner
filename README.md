#About:
Cybertrigo presents a automated command-line interface to VirusTotal, Jotti, and NoVirusThanks.
The script gives you the ability to analyze files using multiple services without using a web
browser or a special client. Since Ctaviav is written in Python, it works on Linux^, Mac OS X^, and
Windows^. You must not use this script for commercial purposes or in manner that violates
the vendorâ€™s acceptable use policy.
With the ability to upload files on the Ctaviav command line, you can easily automate submissions
and retrieve the results. For example, you could create a second script to extract
potentially dangerous attachments from a local MBOX file or from a remote POP3/IMAP
account; then pass the attachments to Ctaviav.py.
